# Getting Started with Machine Learning

Before we dive into the exciting world of machine learning, let's ensure you have everything needed for a smooth workshop experience.

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- A computer (laptop or desktop)
- Working webcam (built-in or external)
- Stable internet connection
- Modern web browser (Chrome recommended)

### Software Setup

1. **Browser Check**

   ```

2. Click the "Get Started" button

3. Select project type:
   - Choose "Image Project"
   - Click "Standard image model"
   - This creates a new blank project

### 2. Understanding the Interface

The Teachable Machine interface has several key areas:

1. **Class Panel** (Left)

   - Where you'll create and manage classes
   - Each class represents a category to recognize

2. **Preview Panel** (Center)

   - Shows live webcam feed
   - Displays model predictions when trained

3. **Training Panel** (Right)
   - Contains the "Train Model" button
   - Shows training progress and stats

## Workspace Organization

For this workshop, you'll want to:

1. Clear your workspace of distractions
