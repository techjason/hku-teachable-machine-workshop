# Testing and Evaluating Your Model

## Why Testing Matters

Testing helps us understand:

- How well our model performs
- Where it might fail
- How to improve it
- When it's ready to use

## Types of Testing

### 1. Real-Time Testing

```
Using the Preview Panel:
- Live webcam feed
- Immediate feedback
- Quick iterations
```

### 2. Systematic Testing

```
Methodical approach:
- Test each class
- Try variations
- Document results
- Identify patterns
```

### 3. Edge Case Testing

```
Testing limits:
- Unusual angles
- Poor lighting
- Partial views
- Similar objects
```

## Understanding Model Performance

### 1. Confidence Scores in Detail

#### High Confidence (90-100%)

- Model is very sure
- Clear, typical example
- Core features present
- Good lighting and angle

#### Medium Confidence (50-89%)

- Model is somewhat sure
- Some variation present
- Features partially matched
- Conditions not ideal

#### Low Confidence (Less than 50%)

- Model is uncertain
- Multiple possible matches
- Features unclear
- Poor conditions

### 2. Analyzing Predictions

#### Good Predictions

```
Example:
Thumbs Up → 95% confident
Peace Sign → 2% confident
Open Palm → 3% confident

Why good?
- Clear winner
- Low confusion
- Makes sense
```

#### Problematic Predictions

```
Example:
Thumbs Up → 45% confident
Peace Sign → 40% confident
Open Palm → 15% confident

Why problematic?
- No clear winner
- High confusion
- Uncertain decision
```

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Basic Testing Protocol

1. **Prepare Test Cases**

   - Different angles
   - Various distances
   - Different lighting
   - Multiple backgrounds

2. **Record Results**

   ```
   Test Case | Expected | Actual | Confidence
   Front     | Thumbs Up| Thumbs Up| 95%
   Side      | Thumbs Up| Confused | 60%
   Far       | Thumbs Up| Wrong    | 30%
   ```

3. **Analyze Patterns**
   - Where does it work well?
   - Where does it fail?
   - Any consistent issues?

### 2. Advanced Testing

#### Environmental Variations

- Indoor vs outdoor lighting
- Different times of day
- Various backgrounds
- Moving subjects

#### User Variations

- Different people
- Different skin tones
- Different sizes
- Different styles

#### Technical Variations

- Camera angles
- Camera quality
- Screen brightness
- Network speed

## Common Testing Issues

### 1. Overfitting Detection

```
Signs:
- Perfect on training data
- Poor on new examples
- No uncertainty

Solution:
- More varied training data
- Test with new users
- Add variations
```

### 2. Bias Detection

```
Signs:
- Works better for some groups
- Consistent errors
- Uneven performance

Solution:
- Diverse training data
- Systematic testing
- Regular evaluation
```

### 3. Reliability Issues

```
Signs:
- Inconsistent results
- Random failures
- Environmental sensitivity

Solution:
- More robust training
- Better documentation
- Clear limitations
```
