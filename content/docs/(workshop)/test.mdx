# Advanced Machine Learning Concepts

## Understanding Model Confidence

When your model makes predictions, it shows confidence scores like this:

```js
Smiling: 85%
Surprised: 12%
Neutral: 3%
```

This means:

- The model is 85% confident the input shows a smiling face
- There's some uncertainty, shown by the other percentages
- All confidence scores add up to 100%

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Poor Model Performance

If your model isn't performing well, try:

- Adding more training data
- Ensuring consistent lighting
- Using diverse angles and positions
- Removing confusing or similar images

### 2. Overlapping Classes

Sometimes classes might be too similar:

```
Class 1 (Slight Smile): 55%
Class 2 (Big Smile): 45%
```

Solution:

- Make classes more distinct
- Add more varied training data
- Consider combining similar classes

## Real-World Applications

Examples of similar technology in use:

- Face ID on smartphones
- Security systems
- Medical diagnosis
- Quality control in manufacturing

## Ethical Considerations

Important points to consider:

- Data privacy and consent
- Bias in training data
- Responsible AI deployment
- Societal impact
