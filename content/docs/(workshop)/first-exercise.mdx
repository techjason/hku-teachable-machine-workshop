# Your First Machine Learning Model: Color Classification

## Introduction

Before we dive into complex image recognition, let's start with the simplest possible example: distinguishing between two solid colors. This exercise will help you understand the basic concepts of machine learning without any confusing variables.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand binary classification
- Learn about training data and its impact
- Experience how machine learning models make decisions
- Interpret confidence scores
- Prepare for more complex classification tasks

## Exercise Setup

### What We'll Build

A model that can tell the difference between:

- Red images (Class 1)
- Blue images (Class 2)

### Why Colors?

```
Benefits of starting with colors:
- No ambiguity (100% red vs 100% blue)
- Clear separation between classes
- No background noise
- Perfect for understanding confidence scores
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Images

**Download the Datasets**

{" "}

<DownloadButton url="/assets/colours.zip" label="Download Training Images" /> <DownloadButton
  url="/assets/testing-colours.zip"
  label="Download Testing Images"
/>

The datasets contain:

- **Training set**: Simple red and blue squares with different brightness variations (what the model learns from)
- **Testing set**: A variety of red and blue images to evaluate your model's performance (what the model hasn't seen before)
- All images in PNG format

> **Why separate training and testing data?**  
> In machine learning, we always separate our data into training and testing sets. The training data teaches the model, while the testing data evaluates how well it generalizes to new examples. This helps prevent overfitting (when a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).

### 2. Set Up Teachable Machine

1. **Create Classes**

   - Rename "Class 1" to "Red"
   - Rename "Class 2" to "Blue"

  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Set both classes as "Red" & "Blue"
  </figcaption>
</figure>

2. **Upload Images**

   ```
   For "Red" class:
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select all red images
   - Verify thumbnails show red squares

   For "Blue" class:
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select all blue images
   - Verify thumbnails show blue squares
   ```

<figure>

  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Upload all red and blue images by clicking the "Upload" button
  </figcaption>
</figure>

### 3. Train Your Model

- Click "Train Model"
- Wait for completion (should be very quick)
- Observe the progress bar

  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Click "Train Model" to start training
  </figcaption>
</figure>

## Testing Your Model

### 1. Basic Testing

First, test your model with the training images:

- A red square → Should show high confidence for "Red"
- A blue square → Should show high confidence for "Blue"

### 2. Advanced Testing with Real-World Images

Now, let's test with the more challenging images from the testing dataset:

1. **Slightly Different Red Square**

   - This is similar to our training data but with a slightly different shade
   - The model should still classify it as "Red" with high confidence
   - This tests basic generalization within the same color family

<figure>
  ![Image](/screenshots/task1-step-4.png)
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Test the model with a slightly different red square
  </figcaption>
</figure>

2. **Strawberry Image**

   - A real-world red object
   - Does the model recognize "redness" in natural objects?
   - Observe if the confidence is lower than with the plain squares

<figure>
  ![Image](/screenshots/task1-step-5.png)
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Test the model with a strawberry image
  </figcaption>
</figure>

3. **Blueberry Image**

   - A real-world blue object
   - Does the model recognize "blueness" in natural objects?
   - Compare the confidence level with the plain blue squares

<figure>
  ![Image](/screenshots/task1-step-6.png)
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Test the model with a blueberry image
  </figcaption>
</figure>

4. **Purple Flower**

   - An ambiguous case between red and blue
   - Which class does the model choose?
   - Look at the confidence scores - they should be more balanced
   - This tests the model's decision boundary between red and blue

<figure>
  ![Image](/screenshots/task1-step-7.png)
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Test the model with a purple flower image
  </figcaption>
</figure>

5. **Magnolia Flag**
   - Contains both red and blue elements
   - How does the model handle an image with both classes?
   - The prediction may depend on which color is more dominant
   - This reveals limitations in simple classification models

<figure>
  ![Image](/screenshots/task1-step-8.png)
  <figcaption className="text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">
    Test the model with a magnolia flag image
  </figcaption>
</figure>

> **Learning Point:** Notice how the model's confidence decreases as we move from simple squares to complex real-world objects. This demonstrates an important concept in machine learning: models perform best on data similar to what they were trained on.

### 3. Understanding Confidence

```
Perfect Case:
Red image:
- Red: 100%
- Blue: 0%

Blue image:
- Red: 0%
- Blue: 100%
```

## Learning Points

### 1. Clear Separation vs. Real-World Complexity

```
What we learned:
- Simple squares: Clear separation between classes
- Real-world objects: More complex features and variations
- The gap between idealized training and real-world application
```

### 2. Confidence Scores and Uncertainty

```
What to observe:
- High confidence on training-like data
- Lower confidence on real-world objects
- Uncertainty with ambiguous cases (purple, mixed images)
- How confidence reflects model reliability
```

### 3. Generalization

- The model's ability to apply learning to new examples
- Limitations when test data differs significantly from training data
- The importance of diverse, representative training examples

### 4. Key Machine Learning Concepts Learned

1. **Binary Classification**

   - Understanding how models choose between two options
   - Observing decision boundaries between classes

2. **Training vs. Testing Data**

   - Why we separate data into different sets
   - How to evaluate model performance on unseen data

3. **Feature Recognition**

   - How models identify "redness" and "blueness" beyond simple squares
   - The challenge of extracting relevant features from complex images

4. **Model Limitations**
   - What happens with edge cases and ambiguous examples
   - How to interpret and understand model predictions

## Next Steps

This exercise used colors because they're perfectly separated. In the real world, things aren't always so clear-cut. In our next exercise, we'll work with shapes, where:

- We'll have more than two classes
- Some shapes might look similar to others
- The same shape can appear different depending on rotation
