# Training Data: The Foundation of Machine Learning

## What is Training Data?

Training data is the set of examples we use to teach our machine learning model. Think of it as the "textbook" from which your model learns:

```
Training Data = Examples + Labels
Example: Image of a cat + Label "Cat"
```

## Quality vs. Quantity

### The Balance

```
Better to have:
100 high-quality examples
than
1000 poor-quality examples
```

### Quality Factors

1. **Clarity**

   - Clear subject
   - Good lighting
   - In focus
   - Minimal noise

2. **Relevance**

   - Shows key features
   - Represents real use cases
   - Appropriate context

3. **Variety**
   - Different angles
   - Different conditions
   - Different backgrounds

## Data Collection Best Practices

### 1. Planning Your Collection

#### Before Starting:

- Define clear classes
- Plan variety needed
- Set up good conditions
- Prepare backgrounds

#### Minimum Requirements:

```
Per Class:
- At least 20 examples
- 5 different angles
- 3 different distances
- 2 lighting conditions
```

### 2. Capturing Quality Data

#### Camera Setup

- Clean lens
- Stable position
- Good lighting
- Neutral background

#### Subject Position

- Center frame
- Appropriate distance
- Clear visibility
- Consistent pose

### 3. Organizing Your Data

#### Structure:

```
Class 1/
  ├── front_view/
  ├── side_view/
  └── varied_lighting/
Class 2/
  ├── front_view/
  ├── side_view/
  └── varied_lighting/
```

## Practical Exercise: Data Collection

### Exercise 1: Basic Collection

1. **Setup**

   - Clear workspace
   - Position camera
   - Check lighting
   - Prepare backgrounds

2. **For Each Class**

   - Record 20 examples
   - Vary slightly:
     - Position
     - Angle
     - Expression

3. **Review Quality**
   - Check each image
   - Remove blurry ones
   - Ensure variety
   - Maintain balance

### Exercise 2: Adding Variations

1. **Position Variations**

   ```
   - Center (10 images)
   - Slightly left (5 images)
   - Slightly right (5 images)
   ```

2. **Distance Variations**

   ```
   - Normal distance (10 images)
   - Closer (5 images)
   - Further (5 images)
   ```

3. **Lighting Variations**
   ```
   - Normal lighting (10 images)
   - Brighter (5 images)
   - Dimmer (5 images)
   ```

## Common Data Collection Mistakes

### 1. Insufficient Variety

```
Problem: All photos too similar
Impact: Model doesn't generalize
Solution: Deliberately vary conditions
```

### 2. Class Imbalance

```
Problem: Different amounts per class
Impact: Biased predictions
Solution: Keep classes balanced
```

### 3. Background Dependence

```
Problem: Consistent background
Impact: Model learns background
Solution: Vary backgrounds
```

## Advanced Data Collection

### 1. Edge Cases

- Unusual angles
- Extreme lighting
- Partial visibility
- Motion blur

### 2. Negative Examples

- Similar but different
- Common confusions
- Border cases

### 3. Validation Data

- Separate from training
- Different conditions
- Real-world scenarios

## Data Collection Checklist

### Before Collection

- [ ] Classes defined
- [ ] Equipment ready
- [ ] Environment prepared
- [ ] Plan for variations

### During Collection

- [ ] Check quality
- [ ] Monitor variety
- [ ] Balance classes
- [ ] Document conditions

### After Collection

- [ ] Review all data
- [ ] Remove poor examples
- [ ] Verify balance
- [ ] Test representative samples
