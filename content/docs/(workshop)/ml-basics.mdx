## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from examples rather than being explicitly programmed. Think of it like teaching a child:

- **Traditional Programming**:

  ```
  IF (sees_round_orange_object) AND (has_bumpy_texture) THEN "it's an orange"
  ```

- **Machine Learning**:
  Show many examples of oranges and non-oranges, and let the computer learn the patterns

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pattern Recognition

Computers learn to recognize patterns in data. These patterns can be in:

- üñºÔ∏è Images (what we'll work with)
- üîä Sound
- üìù Text
- üî¢ Numbers
- üìä Any type of data

### 2. Learning from Examples

Instead of writing rules, we:

1. Collect examples (data) ‚Üí 2. Label them (training data) ‚Üí 3. Let the computer find patterns ‚Üí 4. Use these patterns to make predictions

| Unsupervised Learning  | - Computer finds patterns without labels<br/>- Discovers natural groupings in data                                               | - Customer segmentation<br/>- Anomaly detection                    |
| Reinforcement Learning | - Learning through trial and error<br/>- Like training a pet with rewards                                                        | - Game playing AI<br/>- Robot navigation                           |

## How Computers "See" Images

### Digital Images

1. **Pixels**

   - Images are grids of numbers
   - Each pixel has color values (RGB)
   - Example:
     ```
     Red pixel: [255, 0, 0]
     Green pixel: [0, 255, 0]
     Blue pixel: [0, 0, 255]
     ```

2. **Features**
   - Patterns of pixels
   - Edges, corners, textures
   - Colors and shapes
   - Combinations of simpler features

### From Pixels to Predictions

1. Image input ‚Üí Grid of numbers
2. Find important features
3. Learn which features match which classes
4. Make predictions based on features

## The Learning Process

### 1. Training Phase

- Show labeled examples
- Computer adjusts internal parameters
- Learns to recognize patterns
- Gets better with more examples

### 2. Testing Phase

- Show new, unseen examples
- Computer makes predictions
- We evaluate accuracy
- Identify areas for improvement

## Why Machine Learning?

### Advantages

- Can handle complex patterns
- Adapts to new data
- Works with unstructured data
- Automates pattern recognition

### Limitations

- Needs good quality data
- Can be computationally intensive
- May learn unwanted biases
- Not good for simple, rule-based tasks

## Practical Exercise

Before moving on, try this thought exercise:

1. Think of how you recognize a cat:

   - What features do you look for?
   - How many examples did you need to learn?
   - How do you handle variations?

2. Now imagine teaching a computer:
   - What features might it need?
   - How many examples would help?
   - What variations should we include?
