# Shape Classification: Handling Similar Classes

## Introduction

Now that you've mastered binary classification with colors, let's tackle a more challenging scenario: classifying shapes. This exercise introduces concepts like multi-class classification and dealing with similar-looking classes.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Work with multiple classes (beyond binary classification)
- Understand how models handle similar-looking inputs
- Learn about model confusion and ambiguity
- Experience how rotation and perspective affect classification
- Build upon confidence score interpretation

## Exercise Setup

### What We'll Build

A model that can distinguish between three shapes:

- Circles (Class 1)
- Squares (Class 2)
- Octagons (Class 3)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Training Data

**Download the Datasets**

{" "}

<DownloadButton url="/assets/shapes.zip" label="Download Training Images" /> <DownloadButton
  url="/assets/testing-shapes.zip"
  label="Download Testing Images"
/>

The datasets contain:

- **Training set**: Basic shape variations for training your model
- **Testing set**: Challenging shapes to evaluate your model's performance
- All images in PNG format

> **Why these testing images?**  
> The testing images include ambiguous cases, rotated shapes, and real-world objects that will challenge your model and demonstrate important concepts like decision boundaries and generalization.

2. **Understanding the Dataset**
   ```
   Key Features:
   - Circles: Perfect roundness
   - Squares: Sharp 90° angles
   - Octagons: 8 sides (between circle and square)
   ```

### 2. Set Up Teachable Machine

1. **Create Three Classes**

   - Name Class 1 "Circle"
   - Name Class 2 "Square"
   - Name Class 3 "Octagon"

2. **Upload Training Images**
   ```
   For each class:
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select all images for that shape
   - Verify thumbnails show correct shapes
   ```

### 3. Train Your Model

1. **Training Process**

   - Click "Train Model"
   - Training will take longer than the color exercise
   - Watch the progress bar

2. **Expected Results**
   ```
   Typical Confidence Scores:
   Circle → 85-95% Circle
   Square → 90-100% Square
   Octagon → 75-85% Octagon
   ```

## Testing and Understanding

### 1. Basic Shape Testing

Test with the provided images:

- Show a circle → Should be highly confident
- Show a square → Should be very confident
- Show an octagon → Might show some confusion

### 2. Understanding Confusion

```
Expected Confusion Patterns:
Octagon might be seen as:
- Mostly Octagon (e.g., 80%)
- Partially Circle (e.g., 15%)
- Rarely Square (e.g., 5%)

This is normal and expected!
```

### 3. Advanced Testing

Try these experiments with the testing images:

1. **Ambiguous Octagon-Circle Hybrid**

   - A shape with many sides that looks almost like a circle
   - Observe how confidence is distributed between classes
   - This demonstrates decision boundaries between similar shapes

2. **Rotated Square (Diamond)**

   - A perfect square rotated 45°
   - Does the model still recognize it as a square?
   - This shows the importance of rotation-invariant features

3. **Real-World Object Collage**

   - Multiple shapes in one image
   - How does the model handle complex scenes?
   - This reveals limitations of simple classification

4. **Perspective-Distorted Square**

   - A square viewed from an angle
   - Tests if the model can handle perspective distortion
   - Demonstrates challenges of real-world perception

5. **Incomplete/Partial Shape**
   - Half of a circle or other partial shape
   - Tests how the model handles incomplete information
   - Shows robustness to occlusion or cropping
   - **Interesting observation**: The partial circle is often recognized as an octagon! Think about why this might happen.

> **Discussion Point**: Why might a partial circle be classified as an octagon rather than a circle sometimes?

## Learning Points

### 1. Multi-Class Complexity

```
Key Differences from Color Exercise:
- More than two choices
- Less confident predictions
- Natural overlap between classes
```

### 2. Understanding Confusion

```
Why Confusion Happens:
- Octagons share features with circles
- Rotation affects recognition
- Size and perspective matter
```

### 3. Real-World Applications

This exercise demonstrates:

- Why perfect accuracy isn't always possible
- How similar classes affect confidence
- Importance of diverse training data

### 4. Key Machine Learning Concepts

1. **Multi-Class Classification**

   - Moving beyond yes/no decisions
   - Handling multiple possibilities
   - Understanding class relationships

2. **Feature Similarity**

   - How models handle similar inputs
   - Impact of shared characteristics
   - Importance of distinctive features

3. **Model Confusion**
   - Natural uncertainty
   - Confidence distribution
   - Acceptable confusion levels

## Next Steps

Now that you understand:

- Binary classification (colors)
- Multi-class classification (shapes)
- How to handle similar classes

You're ready to move on to real-world applications! In the next exercise, we'll work with hand gestures using your webcam, where you'll encounter:

- Natural variation in gestures
- Real-time classification
- Personal differences in gesture styles
