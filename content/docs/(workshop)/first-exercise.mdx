# Your First Machine Learning Model: Color Classification

## Introduction

Before we dive into complex image recognition, let's start with the simplest possible example: distinguishing between two solid colors. This exercise will help you understand the basic concepts of machine learning without any confusing variables.

## Exercise Setup

### What We'll Build

A model that can tell the difference between:

- Red images (Class 1)
- Blue images (Class 2)

### Why Colors?

```
Benefits of starting with colors:
- No ambiguity (100% red vs 100% blue)
- Clear separation between classes
- No background noise
- Perfect for understanding confidence scores
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your Images

1. **Download the Training Images**

   - [Download Red Images](/workshop-files/red-squares.zip)
   - [Download Blue Images](/workshop-files/blue-squares.zip)

   Each zip file contains:

   - 10 images of solid color squares
   - Different brightness variations
   - All in PNG format

2. **Alternative: Create Your Own**
   - Open Paint or any image editor
   - Create a new 500x500 pixel image
   - Fill with pure red (#FF0000)
   - Save as PNG
   - Repeat for blue (#0000FF)

### 2. Set Up Teachable Machine

1. **Create Classes**

   - Rename "Class 1" to "Red"
   - Rename "Class 2" to "Blue"

2. **Upload Images**

   ```
   For "Red" class:
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select all red images
   - Verify thumbnails show red squares

   For "Blue" class:
   - Click "Upload"
   - Select all blue images
   - Verify thumbnails show blue squares
   ```

### 3. Train Your Model

1. **Start Training**

   - Click "Train Model"
   - Wait for completion (should be very quick)
   - Observe the progress bar

2. **Understanding Results**
   ```
   Expected Behavior:
   Show red image → 99-100% "Red"
   Show blue image → 99-100% "Blue"
   ```

## Testing Your Model

### 1. Basic Testing

Try showing the model:

- A red image → Should show high confidence for "Red"
- A blue image → Should show high confidence for "Blue"

### 2. Understanding Confidence

```
Perfect Case:
Red image:
- Red: 100%
- Blue: 0%

Blue image:
- Red: 0%
- Blue: 100%
```

### 3. Try Variations

Test with:

- Different shades of red
- Different shades of blue
- Other colors (what happens?)

## Learning Points

### 1. Clear Separation

```
Why this works so well:
- Red and blue are completely different
- No overlap between classes
- Easy for the model to distinguish
```

### 2. Confidence Scores

```
What to observe:
- Very high confidence (near 100%)
- Very low confusion
- Clear decisions
```

### 3. Perfect vs Real World

- This is an idealized example
- Real-world cases are rarely this clear
- Good for understanding basic concepts

## Next Steps

After mastering this basic example, we'll move on to more challenging scenarios:

1. Adding a third color
2. Using mixed colors
3. Working with real objects
