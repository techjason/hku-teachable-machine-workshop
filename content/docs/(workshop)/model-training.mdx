# Preparing to Train Your First ML Model

## What is Machine Learning?

Think of machine learning like teaching a computer to recognize patterns:

```
Traditional Programming:
Rules → Computer → Output

Machine Learning:
Examples → Computer → Rules → Output
```

## How Training Works

### The Basic Process

```
1. Show Examples (Training Data)
2. Computer Finds Patterns
3. Computer Makes Rules
4. Test with New Examples
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

```
Your Role:
- Provide clear examples
- Label them correctly
- Test the results

Computer's Role:
- Find patterns in data
- Create recognition rules
- Make predictions
```

## Preparing Your Training Data

### 1. Quality Matters

```
Good Examples Are:
✓ Clear and consistent
✓ Well-labeled
✓ Representative
✓ Varied enough

Bad Examples Are:
✗ Blurry or unclear
✗ Mislabeled
✗ Too similar
✗ Too different
```

### 2. Quantity Guidelines

```
For Simple Tasks:
- Start with 10-20 examples per class
- Add more if needed

For Complex Tasks:
- Start with 20-30 examples per class
- Vary conditions and angles
```

### 3. Organizing Classes

```
Best Practices:
- Clear class names
- Distinct categories
- Even distribution
- Good variety
```

## What to Expect

### 1. Confidence Scores

```
The model shows confidence as percentages:

High (90-100%):
"I'm very sure this is a cat!"

Medium (70-89%):
"This looks like a cat..."

Low (<70%):
"I'm not really sure..."
```

### 2. Training Time

```
Factors That Affect Training:
- Number of examples
- Number of classes
- Complexity of task
- Computer speed
```

### 3. Common Challenges

```
You Might See:
- Confusion between similar items
- Lower confidence on new examples
- Unexpected predictions
- Need for more training data
```

## Before You Start

### Checklist for Success

1. **Plan Your Classes**

   - Choose clear categories
   - Make them distinct
   - Start simple

2. **Prepare Examples**

   - Gather good samples
   - Check quality
   - Ensure variety

3. **Set Expectations**
   - Start small
   - Test often
   - Be patient

## Your Learning Path

We'll practice these concepts in three exercises, each teaching different aspects:

### 1. Color Classification

```
What You'll Learn:
- Basic classification
- Perfect separation
- Clear results
```

### 2. Shape Classification

```
What You'll Learn:
- Multiple classes
- Similar shapes
- Pattern recognition
```

### 3. Hand Gestures

```
What You'll Learn:
- Real-time input
- Natural variation
- Practical application
```
